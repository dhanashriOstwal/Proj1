# Questions

### What server framework did you choose and why?
 [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/). - Because it is really fast. It also has the benefit of being able to scale much higher. So, performance wise node js is better.

### What client framework did you choose and why?
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) - Because I was eager to use MVC framework.Angular manages the components for us and also serves as the pipeline to connect them. Angular implements MVC by asking to split the app into MVC components, then Angular does the rest.

### What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
Implementing Angular JS was relatively easy because I have experience with javascript. So, learning and implementing Angular JS was simple.

### What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
Uploading on heroku was a challenge because there were fewer links to refer and figuring out the error was quite difficult.

### What components OTHER than your client and server framework did you install, if any, and if so, what is their purpose for your solution?
**Google Services** - Used it for implementing Google Maps and Bar Chart. 

### What commands are required to deploy and run your server?
```sh
git push heroku master
heroku open
```
